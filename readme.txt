This plugin will automatically update the status of your sold items based on their shipping status. Only for the Brazilian sellers that use WooCommerce.

== Description ==

This plugin will give you the automation you needed: with it your sold items will be updated to completed when their shipping end.
This is only available for Brazilian stores that use correios and WooCommerce.

Esse plugin depende do WooCommerce e do plugin dos correios.
